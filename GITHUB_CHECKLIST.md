3. **Configure branch protection rules** for main branch
4. **Add repository topics/tags** for better discoverability
5. **Create releases** for version management

### 5. Environment Setup for Contributors

Make sure contributors know to:

1. Copy `.env.example` files to `.env`
2. Fill in their own API keys and configuration
3. Follow the setup instructions in README.md
4. Check CONTRIBUTING.md for development guidelines
